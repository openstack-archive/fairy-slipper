Validate token
==============

.. rest_method::  GET /v2.0/OS-KSVALIDATE/token/validate

Checks that a token is valid and that it belongs to the tenant and any service IDs. Returns the permissions for a particular client.

Behavior is similar to ``/tokens/{tokenId}``. If the token is not
valid, the call returns the ``itemNotFound (404)`` response code.

This extension might decrypt the ``X-Subject-Token`` header and
internally call and pass in all headers and query parameters to the
normal validation code for Identity. Consequently, this extension
must support all existing ``/tokens/{tokenId}`` calls including
extensions such as HP-IDM.


Normal response codes: 200
Error response codes:203,413,405,404,403,401,400,503,
