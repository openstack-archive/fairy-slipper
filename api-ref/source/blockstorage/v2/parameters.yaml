    The volume type. To create an environment with

    ``cinder- volume.HOST.BACKEND``. For example, ``cinder-
    volume.ubuntu.lvmdriver``. When a volume is created, the scheduler
    chooses an appropriate back end to handle the request based on the
    volume type.  Default is ``None``.  For information about how to
    use volume types to create multiple- storage back ends, see
