    are:  - **Byte range specification**. Use FIRST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the   start of the data range, and LAST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the end.   You can omit the LAST_BYTE_OFFSET and if you
    do, the value   defaults to the offset of the last byte of data.

    the length of the data range.  The following forms of the header
    specify the following ranges of data:  - ``Range: bytes=-5``. The
    last five bytes.  - ``Range: bytes=10-15``. The five bytes of data

    part response that contains the   last five bytes and the five
    bytes of data after a 10-byte   offset. The ``Content-Type``
    response header contains   ``multipart/byteranges``.  - ``Range:
    bytes=4-6``. Bytes 4 to 6 inclusive.  - ``Range: bytes=2-2``. Byte
    2, the third byte of the data.  - ``Range: bytes=6-``. Byte 6 and
    after.  - ``Range: bytes=1-3,2-5``. A multi-part response that

    that verifies the origin is allowed to make the request. The

    listed in this header parameter, and issues a 401 if the
    originating URL is not allowed to make a cross-origin request.

    Sets a container access control list (ACL) that grants read access.
    Container ACLs are available on any Object Storage cluster, and are

              "X-Container-Read: ACL" STORAGE_URL/CONTAINER

    you include them in the header.  Using PUT with ``X-Copy-From``
    has the same effect as using the COPY operation to copy an object.

    extra transaction information when you upload `large objects
    <http://docs.openstack.org/user-
    guide/cli_swift_large_object_creation.html>`_ such as images. When
    you upload each segment and the manifest, include the same value
    in the ``X-Trans-Id-Extra`` request header. If an error occurs,
    you can find all requests that are related to the large object
    upload in the Object Storage logs.  You can also use ``X-Trans-Id-
    Extra`` strings to help operators debug requests that fail to
    receive responses. The operator can search for the extra
    information in the logs.

    Enables versioning on this container. The value
    is the name of another container. You must UTF-8-encode and then

    disable versioning, set the header to an empty string.

# variables in path
account:
  description: |
    The unique name for the account. An account is
    also known as the project or tenant.
  in: path
  required: false
  type: string
container:
  description: |
    The unique name for the container.  The container
    name must be from 1 to 256 characters long and can start with any
    character and contain any pattern. Character set must be UTF-8.
    The container name cannot contain a slash (``/``) character
    because this character delimits the container and object name. For
    example, ``/account/container/object``.

# variables in query
delimiter:
  description: |
    Delimiter value, which returns the object names
    that are nested in the container. If you do not set a prefix and
    set the delimiter to "/" you may get unexpected results where all
    the objects are returned instead of only those with the delimiter
    set.
  in: query

  type: string
end_marker:
  description: |
    For a string value, x , returns container names
    that are less than the marker value.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
filename:
  description: |
    Overrides the default file name. Object Storage
    generates a default file name for GET temporary URLs that is based
    on the object name. Object Storage returns this value in the
    ``Content-Disposition`` response header. Browsers can interpret
    this file name value as a file attachment to save. For more
    information about temporary URLs, see `Temporary URL middleware
    <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/
    swift/api/temporary_url_middleware.html>`_.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
format:
  description: |
    The response format. Valid values are ``json``,
    ``xml``, or ``plain``. The default is ``plain``.  If you append
    the ``format=xml`` or ``format=json`` query parameter to the
    storage account URL, the response shows extended container
    information serialized in that format.  If you append the
    ``format=plain`` query parameter, the response lists the container
    names separated by newlines.

  type: string
multipart-manifest_1:
  description: |
    If you include the ``multipart-manifest=delete``
    query parameter and the object is a static large object, the
    segment objects and manifest object are deleted. If you omit the
    ``multipart- manifest=delete`` query parameter and the object is a
    static large object, the manifest object is deleted but the
    segment objects are not deleted.  For a bulk delete, the response
    body looks the same as it does for a normal bulk delete. In
    contrast, a plain object DELETE response has an empty body.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
multipart-manifest_2:
  description: |
    If you include the ``multipart-manifest=get``
    query parameter and the object is a large object, the object
    contents are not returned. Instead, the manifest is returned in
    the ``X-Object-Manifest`` response header for dynamic large
    objects or in the response body for static large objects.

temp_url_expires:
  description: |
    The date and time in `UNIX Epoch time stamp
    format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_ when the
    signature for temporary URLs expires.  For example, ``1440619048``
