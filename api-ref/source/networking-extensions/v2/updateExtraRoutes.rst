The next hop IP address must be a part of one of the subnets to
which the router interfaces are connected. Otherwise, the server

address or CIDR, the server responds with the ``Bad Request (400)``

When Networking receives a request to delete the router interface
for subnets that are used by one or more routes, it responds with a
``Conflict (409)`` response code.
