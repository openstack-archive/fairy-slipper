    The date and time stamp format is `ISO 8601
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_:

    ::

       CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm

    The ``±hh:mm`` value, if included, returns the time zone as an
    offset from UTC.

    For example, ``2015-08-27T09:49:58-05:00``.

    If you omit the time zone, the UTC time zone is assumed.
