device:
  in: body
  required: false
  type: string
  description: |
    Name of the device such as, ``/dev/vdb``. Omit or
    set this parameter to null for auto-assignment, if supported. If
    you specify this parameter, the device must not exist in the guest
    operating system. Note that as of the 12.0.0 Liberty release, the
    Nova libvirt driver no longer honors a user-supplied device name.
    This is the same behavior as if the device name parameter is not
    supplied on the request.
