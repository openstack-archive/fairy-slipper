x-openstack-request-id:
  in: header
  required: false
  type: string
  description: |
    A unique ID for tracking the request. The request
    ID associated with the request appears in the log lines for that
    request. By default, the middleware configuration ensures that the
    request ID appears in the log files.

    Moves to the previous metadata item.

next:

tenant_id:
  in: path
  required: false
  type: string
  description: |
    The UUID of the tenant in a multi-tenancy cloud.

changes-since:
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
  description: |
    Filters the response by a date and time when the image last changed
    status.

    Use this query parameter to check for changes since a previous
    request rather than re-downloading and re-parsing the full status
    at each polling interval. If data has changed, the call returns
    only the items changed since the ``changes-since`` time. If data
    has not changed since the ``changes-since`` time, the call returns
    an empty list.

    To enable you to keep track of changes, this filter also displays
    images that were deleted if the ``changes-since`` value specifies a
    date in the last 30 days. Items deleted more than 30 days ago might
    be returned, but it is not guaranteed.

    The date and time stamp format is `ISO 8601
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_:

    ::

       CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm

    The ``±hh:mm`` value, if included, returns the time zone as an
    offset from UTC.

    For example, ``2015-08-27T09:49:58-05:00``.

    If you omit the time zone, the UTC time zone is assumed.

minRam:
  in: query

limit:
  in: query
  required: false
  type: integer
  description: |
    Requests a page size of items. Returns a number
    of items up to a limit value. Use the ``limit`` parameter to make
    an initial limited request and use the ID of the last-seen item
    from the response as the ``marker`` parameter value in a
    subsequent limited request.

marker:
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
  description: |
    The ID of the last-seen item. Use the ``limit``
