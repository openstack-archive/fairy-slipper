</div>

An Application Programming Interface (API) offers a way to use the
capabilities of a service by using predefined functions. Use the API
when the programming language you're using is not supported in an
SDK. Please consider contributing that work to one of the 
<a href="http://developer.openstack.org/">known SDKs</a>.
The <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/">
OpenStack API Guide</a> gives you the basics for interacting with the services.
